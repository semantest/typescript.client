# 🚀 Independent Testing Guide

**Carlos's Integration Update**: Each team member can now test independently!

## 🎯 No More Bottlenecks!

You no longer need to wait for me to test the extension. Each team member can:
- Build and test their own components
- Reload the extension themselves
- Run tests independently
- Commit their own changes

## 🧪 Testing Your Component

### For Wences (Browser/Extension)
```bash
# Test only browser components
npm run test:browser

# Or use interactive menu
npm run test:independent
# Select option 1
```

### For Elena (CLI)
```bash
# Test only CLI components
npm run test:cli

# Or use interactive menu
npm run test:independent
# Select option 2
```

### For Fran (Server)
```bash
# Test only server components
npm run test:server

# Or use interactive menu
npm run test:independent
# Select option 3
```

### For Carlos (Integration)
```bash
# Test integration components
npm run test:integration
```

## 🔴 Current TDD Status

All tests are in **RED phase** (failing) - this is correct!

```bash
# See current test status
npm test

# Expected output:
# Browser tests: 🔴 15 failing (Wences)
# CLI tests: 🔴 12 failing (Elena)
# Server tests: 🔴 (Fran - in progress)
```

## ✅ Making Tests GREEN

### Step 1: Run your tests
```bash
npm run test:watch  # Auto-runs on changes
```

### Step 2: Implement minimum code
Write ONLY enough code to make ONE test pass at a time.

### Step 3: Commit each green test
```bash
# After making a test pass:
git add src/your-component/
git commit --no-gpg-sign -m "feat: ✅ make [specific test] pass"
```

## 🔄 Workflow Without Bottlenecks

1. **Pull latest changes**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

2. **Run your tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:your-component
   ```

3. **Make ONE test pass**
   - Write minimal code
   - Don't over-engineer

4. **Commit immediately**
   ```bash
   git commit --no-gpg-sign -m "feat: ✅ [what you did]"
   ```

5. **Push frequently**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## 🌐 Testing the Extension (Wences)

You can reload and test the extension yourself:

1. **Build the extension**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Load in Chrome**
   - Open chrome://extensions/
   - Enable Developer mode
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist` folder

3. **Test on ChatGPT**
   - Go to chat.openai.com
   - Open DevTools Console
   - Check for idle/busy detection logs

## 📊 Coverage Reports

Each component generates its own coverage:

```bash
# View coverage for your component
open coverage/your-component/index.html
```

## 🚨 Integration Points

While you can test independently, remember these integration points:

| From | To | Event |
|------|-----|-------|
| Elena (CLI) | Carlos (Router) | `ChatGPTInteractionRequested` |
| Carlos (Router) | Fran (Server) | `RouteToServer` |
| Fran (Server) | Wences (Browser) | `WebSocketMessage` |
| Wences (Browser) | ChatGPT | `InjectAndExecute` |

## 💡 Tips for Independent Work

1. **Focus on your domain** - Don't worry about other components
2. **Mock dependencies** - Use Jest mocks for external services
3. **Test in isolation** - Each component should work standalone
4. **Communicate issues** - If you find integration problems, tell Carlos

## 🔐 Remember: Commit Frequently!

```bash
# Configure once (if not done)
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

# Then commit often
git commit --no-gpg-sign -m "test: 🔴 [what test you added]"
git commit --no-gpg-sign -m "feat: ✅ [what test you fixed]"
git commit --no-gpg-sign -m "refactor: 🔄 [what you improved]"
```

**No more waiting! Each team member can work independently!**
- Wences can test the browser extension
- Elena can test the CLI
- Fran can test the server
- Everyone can build and deploy

Let's move fast and break the bottleneck! 🚀
